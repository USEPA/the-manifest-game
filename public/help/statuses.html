      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Understanding Manifest Statuses</h2>
      <p class="max-w-prose text-slate-800">
        The e-Manifest module uses a series of statuses to indicate the current stage of the
        manifest. The current status, and your role, will dictate whether you can sign, edit, or pay
        for the manifest. Here are the key statuses you'll encounter:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-none space-y-4 p-3">
        <li>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Draft</h3>
          <p class="max-w-prose text-slate-800">
            At this stage, the electronic manifest is only visible to the site that drafted the
            electronic manifest. It does not have an “ELC” suffix manifest tracking number (MTN)
            assigned to it by the system.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Pending</h3>
          <p class="max-w-prose text-slate-800">
            A manifest is in the "Pending" status when it has been created but not yet approved by
            the designated receiving facility. The designated receiving facility needs to move the
            status to “Scheduled” before it can be signed by the generator and initial transporter.
            This manifest will have an MTN assigned.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Scheduled</h3>
          <p class="max-w-prose text-slate-800">
            Once the TSDF approves the shipment, it is ready for the generator and the initial
            transporter to sign.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">In Transit</h3>
          <p class="max-w-prose text-slate-800">
            Signifies that the manifest is currently being transported to the designated facility.
            This status is skipped if there is only one transporter listed on the manifest.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Ready For Signature</h3>
          <p class="max-w-prose text-slate-800">
            Once all transporters listed on the manifest have signed, it is the designed receiving
            facility’s turn to sign upon receipt. This is the first status of paper manifests
            uploaded to the e-Manifest.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Signed</h3>
          <p class="max-w-prose text-slate-800">
            An electronic manifest that has been received by the designated receiving facility but
            is not complete and has not been charged to a bill.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Signed-Complete</h3>
          <p class="max-w-prose text-slate-800">
            A completed electronic manifest or paper manifest that has been submitted by the
            designated receiving facility and charged on a bill.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Under Correction</h3>
          <p class="max-w-prose text-slate-800">
            If any discrepancies or errors are found after a manifest has been marked as Signed, it
            can be corrected by any party listed on the manifest or a regulator. All versions of a
            manifest (prior to corrections) are maintained, and viewable, in the e-Manifest system.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Corrected</h3>
          <p class="max-w-prose text-slate-800">
            If a user or regulator submits the correction described in the previous status, it moves
            the status to “Corrected”.

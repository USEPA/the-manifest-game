  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">How to Request Site Access in EPA's RCRAInfo System</h2>
  <div class="space-y-4 p-2">
    <p class="text-left">
      After you register, you will need to request access to your site(s). Requests are reviewed by
      state and EPA regulators; your request should be reviewed within 48 hours. If your request is
      not reviewed within a reasonable timeframe, you can find contact information for state and EPA
      regulators in RCRAInfo.
    </p>
    <p class="text-left">
      RCRAInfo offers various levels of access and multiple modules that the user can utilize for a
      given site. The roles in RCRAInfo are hierarchical, with each role encompassing the
      permissions of the lower roles plus additional permissions. The roles include Viewer,
      Preparer, and Certifier. Each user can hold one of these roles for each module for a site. The
      Site Manager role is equivalent to having the Certifier role for all modules for a site. A
      Site Manager also has the authority to approve other users for that site.

        <h4 class="font-semibold">Select Permission Levels:</h4>
        <p>
          You can select one of the below roles for each module. For the e-Manifest module, the
          roles translate to the following permissions:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-outside list-disc pl-[revert]">
          <li><strong class="text-rcraBlue">Viewer:</strong> View manifests and data.</li>
          <li>
            <strong class="text-rcraBlue">Preparer:</strong> Create, edit, and sign electronic
            manifests.
          </li>
          <li><strong class="text-rcraBlue">Certifier:</strong> Correct and submit manifests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="max-w-prose text-slate-800">
          In addition, you can set <strong class="text-rcraBlue">Site Management</strong> to
          <i>active</i>
          which will give you the Certifier role for all modules, and allow you to approve users,
          manage user permissions and electronic signature agreements, and manage application
          programming interface (API) credentials.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 class="font-semibold">Submit the Request:</h4>
        <p>
          If the site already has a previous Site Manager(s), your request will be directed to them.
          If the site does not already have a Site Manager, your request will be sent to your RCRA
          Authorized state regulatory agency or the US EPA.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4 class="font-semibold">Await Approval:</h4>
        <p>To expedite the process, make sure you registered with your work email address.</p>
        <p>
          If you are not approved within 48 hours, log in to RCRAInfo, and click the
          <span class="text-blue-500">pending</span> link to bring up a list of users who are
          authorized to approve your request and contact them.

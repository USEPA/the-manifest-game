<h2 class="text-xl">What is an EPA ID Number?</h2>
<div class="flex max-w-prose flex-col space-y-4 p-2 [&>p]:text-slate-800">
  <p>An EPA ID number is a unique identifier assigned to facilities that:</p>
  <ol class="list-outside list-decimal pl-[revert]">
    <li>Generate</li>
    <li>Transport</li>
    <li>Treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste</li>
    <li>A combination of the above</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The EPA ID number helps regulatory agencies and stakeholders track the movement and management
    of hazardous waste throughout its lifecycle. It's akin to a license plate for hazardous waste
    handlers, allowing for effective monitoring and regulation.

  <p>
    EPA ID numbers begin with 3 letters representing the state or territory of the facility,
    followed by 9 alphanumeric characters.
  </p>
  <p>
    EPA ID numbers are tied to the physical location rather than its owner or operator. This means
    that if a facility changes ownership or management, the EPA ID number remains associated with
    the site itself.
  </p>
  <h3 class="font-semibold">How to obtain an ID number for your site?</h3>
  <p>
    An EPA ID number is applied for using the Site Identification Form (<a
      class="text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600"
      href="https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/instructions-and-form-hazardous-waste-generators-transporters-and-treatment-storage"
      >form 8700-12</a
    >) or through the myRCRAid module in
    <a href="https://rcrainfo.epa.gov" class="text-blue-500 visited:text-purple-500">RCRAInfo</a>.
    The application is reviewed by your state, whether you apply using the Site Identification Form
    or through RCRAInfo. You will only be able to apply for an EPA ID number through RCRAInfo if
    your state has opted to use the myRCRAid module.
  </p>
  <h3 class="font-semibold">The of IDs in RCRAInfo and e-Manifest</h3>
  <p>
    EPA ID numbers are integral to the e-Manifest system and enable users to connect manifests (when
    submitted from a paper) to their site. If the EPA ID number is missing or submitted incorrectly,
    the system will not be able to associate that manifest with your site. By automatically
    associating manifests with a site, e-Manifest enhances transparency, efficiency, and compliance
    in hazardous waste management, and reduces paperwork and administrative burdens. We encourage
    all sites to obtain an EPA ID.
